## Advanced topics
In this section we walk through miscellaneous topics that can be useful sometimes such as lambdas –a mechanism for implementing functionality for temporary use inside program code–, and exceptions –a way of handling unexpected situations, such as errors.:

* Lambda expressions

* Exception handling



### Code
Following the programs I wrote for this repository, click on each link for a detailed description about them and how to compile/run:

* [**Transcript**](transcript): Trying lambdas in action and more practice with algorithms and iterators.

* [**String Printer**](strprinter): Operator overloading, resource management, inheritance and virtual interfaces, exceptions, etc.

* [**Custom Exception**](custom_exception): Practice creating a template class from scratch.
