This module does not discuss new topics. Instead, the work consists
only of exercises that are organized as follows:

The first two exercises (M5-FILES and M5-TRIPLE) are normal TMC-based
programming exercises. In addition there are four exercises that you
will need to submit in [MyCourses]. These are not checked by TMC,
but will be discussed in the project kick-off session on
Monday, 26.10. By submitting an exercise you will volunteer to
shortly present your view on the particular exercise in the project
kick-off session.
