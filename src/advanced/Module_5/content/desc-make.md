points: 2


Find information about the Make tool and how it is used. You can start
from the
[wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)), but
look also for additional sources of information. Write a short (about
one page) summary of the topic, and **submit your summary in MyCourses**

  * Why does make do, and why is it needed?
  * How is make used? how do you compile programs using make?
    (describe command line usage, needed files, etc.) 
  * Can you use make from IDEs, such as Netbeans?
  * What are make dependencies?
  * Implement a simple makefile, for example on top of the previous
    exercise about SFML, and attach your Makefile as part of this
    submission.
