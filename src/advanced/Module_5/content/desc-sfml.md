task_id: Q1: SFML
points: 2


Investigate
[Simple and Fast Multimedia Library (SFML)](http://www.sfml-dev.org). Write
a short (about one page) summary discussing at least the following
topics, and **submit your summary in MyCourses** (this task is not in
TMC).

  * What is the library used for?
  * How is the library installed, and used as part of a C++ program?
  * What can you say about the naming, name conventions and namespaces
    used in library? 
  * How does SFML handle user input?
  * Install the library, and implement a small test program using
    it. Open a window and add a small moving graphical object (sprite)
    that reacts to user input e.g. by moving the object. What are your
    findings? How many lines of code were needed? Was something
    difficult?
