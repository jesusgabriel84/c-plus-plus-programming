points: 2


list.c (that can be found in MyCourses) contains a program written in
C. Implement tests to check that the program works correctly in
different functions. Pay attention to different special cases: empty
list, misformed parameters, empty strings, removing items at the ends
of the list an so on. Report back any bugs you may find.

Try using the following tools for your tests:

  * **googletest**. You have probably already installed the package for
    the exercises, which include some examples on how it is used 
  * **gcov**, to check that your tests cover all code branches

**Submit your test code to MyCourses**, along with a document
  describing your test findings.
