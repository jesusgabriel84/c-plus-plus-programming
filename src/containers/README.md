## Containers
In this section we will see how the containers work in practice, how to implement them, how to use iterators and some algorithms useful to work with containers:

* Sequential containers:
	* Vector
	* List
	* String
	* Array

* Iterators

* Associative containers:
	* Map
	* Set
	* Multimap
	* Multiset

* Algotihms applied on containers:
	* read-only algorithms
	* Writing algorithms
	* Re-ordering algorithms

For a more detailed information please refer to the official **C++** documentation on [**containers**](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container).

### Code
Following the programs I wrote for this repository, click on each link for a detailed description about them and how to compile/run:

* [**Vector iterators**](vector_iterators): Program to use iterators in vectors.

* [**List**](list): Understanding the basic handling of list, and using input stream as a source.

* [**Matrix rotation**](matrix): Use nested vectors for a two-dimensional matrix.

* [**Library**](library): Use nested vectors for a two-dimensional matrix.

* [**Pokemon**](pokemon): Practice use of algorithms together with a list container.
