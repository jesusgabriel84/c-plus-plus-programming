## Classes
In this section we look in more detailed into C++ classes and object-oriented programming mechanisms, such as inheritance and polymorphism. In addition we also observe how operator overloading works, and how it can be used, for example, together with input and output streams. In the end we will also see how to use the streams in more comprehensive ways, for example when reading or writing files:

* Object oriented programming:
	* Constructors
	* Destructors

* Object relationships in C++:
	* Name visibility netween classes
	* Static members and functions
	* Polymorphism
	* Pure virtual functions and abstract classes

* Operator overloading

* Dynamic Memory allocation in C++

* I/O in C++
	* File streams
	* Condition bits and manipulators
	* String streams


### Code
Following the programs I wrote for this repository, click on each link for a detailed description about them and how to compile/run:

* [**Plynomial**](polynomial): Program to learn to overload various operators.

* [**Birds**](bird): Understanding the abstract classes, inheritance and little bit of operator overloading.

* [**Matrix rotation**](matrix): Use nested vectors for a two-dimensional matrix.

* [**Library**](library): Use nested vectors for a two-dimensional matrix.

* [**Pokemon**](pokemon): Practice use of algorithms together with a list container.




**Compile and run:**
```bash
#In the folder src/containers/vector_iterators
make
cd src
./main
```
