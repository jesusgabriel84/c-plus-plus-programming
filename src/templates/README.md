## Templates
In this section we understand how to use templates, useful to create generic types and functions where same code can be shared to operate on different data types. In addition, we look into smart pointers â€“an applications of templates:

* More about dynamic memory:
	* Copy constructor
	* Copy assignment
	* Preventing copy and assignment
	* [Rule of three and Rule of five](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_of_three_(C%2B%2B_programming)) 

* Smart pointers and resource management:
	* Share pointer
	* Unique pointer
	* Weak pointer

* Generic programming using templates



### Code
Following the programs I wrote for this repository, click on each link for a detailed description about them and how to compile/run:

* [**Dragons**](dragons): Practice abstract classes and inheritance, implement the base class interface and deal with the Rule of Three (RO3).

* [**Tostring**](tostring): Practice and understand the use of templates.

* [**Triple**](triple): Practice creating a template class from scratch.

* [**Restricted pointer**](restr_ptr): Learn to implement your own kind of smart pointers and continue practicing templates.
