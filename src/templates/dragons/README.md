**Objective:** Practice abstract classes and inheritance. This time
  you will also need to implement the base class interface, and deal
  with the Rule of Three (RO3).

In this task you will need to implement various kinds of
dragons. **Dragon** is an abstract base class for different kinds of
dragons:  **FantasyDragon**, **ChineseDragon**, and **MagicDragon**. The
classes are defined in the .hpp files,
and the implementations should be in the .cpp files.

In addition, **DragonCave** (in
*dragon_cave.hpp/cpp*) that stores the different kinds of dragons. DragonCave 
must not allow copying.


**Compile and run:**
```bash
#In the folder src/classes/register
make
cd src
./main
```
